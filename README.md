This code is for converting **rustlog logs (logs.ivr.si)** into the json file which can be used to chat rendering.

Use **TwitchDownloader** to Chat Rendering.

**This code was almost made by ChatGPT and I have little knowledge about coding. So don't ask me any questions.**

Change the name (default is Forsen) if you want to render the other one's chat.


**Known Issues**
1. Old 3rd party emotes cannot be seen.
2. Deleted twitch emotes(e.g. old PogChamp emote) cannot be seen. Archived emotes can be seen. You can see for example DrDisRespect emotes.
3. Banned or timed out messages are not implemented.
4. If sub badges are changed, old ones cannot be seen.
